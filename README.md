# Exercise 1

1. The class that's used to implement the controller pattern is SnappingSheetController.
It allows the developer to control the position of the widget in the "grabbing" property
with the method snapToPosition which takes a SnapPosition as an argument and moves the
widget to this position.

2. a SnappingSheet instance has the property SnapPositions, which takes a list of SnapPosition instances.
Each one of those SnapPositions instances has a property called SnappingCurve which takes an enum from Curves
and controls how the snap would look like.
